### ViGer - About

The application or project this time I named ViGer. My goal for developing this Native-based mobile application is to improve my understanding of how to develop and create a program with Android Studio.

### ViGer - Technology

For the technology from the ViGer project, I developed it with several components, namely:

- Android Studio Bumblebee | 2021.1.1
- Java SDK v. 8
- Android SDK v. 31

### ViGer - Credit

For inspiration from working on the ViGer project that I developed, it came from a youtube channel called [Chirag Kachhadiya](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChiragKachhadiya94) which discusses how to make a mobile application simple dashboard project.

### ViGer - Open Source

For those of you who want to develop this ViGer application even better, I invite you with a note that your goals are for good. In addition, if you really want to make this application commercial, please contact me.
